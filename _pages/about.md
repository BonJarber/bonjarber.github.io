## Hi I'm Jon Barber

I've started my own company to help make the Internet more secure. I'm doing
this in two ways:

1. Sharing my security expertise via consulting.
2. Building tools to find vulnerable assets on the Internet and report them via
bug bounty programs.

## Knowledge

I've been doing AppSec professionally for about 6 years now. My years as an NCC
Group consultant exposed me to hundreds of different apps, networks, and
systems. This gave me a ton of reps breaking applications, and taught me how to
be a useful consultant. My time as a security eningeer on Facebook's prodsec
team taught me the challenges of securing products at a massive scale. Now I'd
like to share this experience with others who need it.

There's an element of personalized, high quality consulting that tooling can't
replace yet. Security is still too human of a space. One of the more valuable
ways I can spend my time is transferring whatever knowledge I have to others.

This knowledge transfer can come in a couple different forms:
- Application penetration test
- System design review
- Secure code review
- Training for your software or security engineers.

If this interests you, head over to the [contact](/contact/index.html) page.

## Scale

The problem I have with consulting is that it doesn't scale well. Growing simply
via bodies means you can't guarantee the quality of services to maintain.
Tooling on the other hand, when built well, can scale massively.

I'm dedicating time to building tooling to more effectively find security bugs
that exist on the Internet. <a href="https://disclose.io/">Safe harbor policies

on companies with such policies.

## Interested?

I'm currently booking new gigs for January and February. If you're interested in
working with me please reach out soon, I'd love to hear what you have in mind.
