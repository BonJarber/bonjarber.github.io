## Hi I'm Jon Barber

For as long as I can remember I've enjoyed building and breaking things. It used to be with legos and washing machines, these days it tends to be software and system designs. Currently my time is spent building tools, doing bug bounty, security research, and consulting.


## My Background

#### Security Engineering @ Facebook
<small>2017 - 2019</small>

In 2017 I joined Facebook's Product Security team in order to learn more about
the defensive side of application security. At Facebook I helped teams build
secure products and was a member of the core team of folks running Facebook's
massive bug bounty program. In that role I learned so much about scale and
leveraging tooling to be a more effective engineer. After working on this team
for a few years I decided I wanted to extend my impact outside the walls of just
Facebook.


#### Penetration Testing @ NCC Group
<small>2015 - 2017</small>

After finishing my Computing Security degree I moved out to Seattle and started with NCC Group (technically it was iSEC partners at the time). As a senior security consultant I lead engagements for penetration testing, code review, and architecture reviews. I found vulnerabilities in web apps, mobile apps, networks, network devices, architecture designs, and source code belonging to some of the top US tech companies. Built tools to make the testing of SAML easier, did research into home routers and <a href="https://infocondb.org/con/toorcon/toorcon-san-diego-18/the-wireless-elephant-in-the-living-room">talked about it</a> at Toorcon San Diego 2016.


#### Application Security @ FactSet
<small>2014 - 2014</small>

The summer of 2014 I took an intern position in the Security Assurance Group at FactSet, a financial data and software company headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut. I worked directly within the team identifying potential risks, threats, vulnerabilities and exploits in FactSet systems, applications, and products through architecture reviews, security assessments, and various penetration testing methods. I managed the remediation of vulnerabilities and offered security advice to Systems and Software Engineers. I also developed tools and scripts to make myself and the team more efficient.


#### Computing Security @ RIT
<small>2009 - 2014</small>

I got my bachelors of science in Computing Security from the Rochester Institute of Technology. I was very active in the security clubs on campus, including serving as President of the RIT Competitive CyberSecurity Club and Vice President of Research of <a href="https://ritpedia.rit.edu/Security_Practices_and_Research_Student_Association">SPARSA</a>. I competed in numerous Capture the Flag and similar competitions.

Fun fact - I also walked away from RIT with a bachelors degree in Film and
Animation. I started out getting a film degree but eventually realized the film
industry was not where I wanted to be developing my career. I pivoted into
Software Engineering first but settled in Computing Security.
