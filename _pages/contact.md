### Don't contact me if

- You're looking for an audit or other checklist assessment. I look to provide
more than just a report full of check marks.
- You need forensic, incident response, or physical security services. Not my
expertise.
- You want an engagement lasting longer than 2-3 weeks at a time. I prefer
short, high impact and time boxed work.
- You need a large amount of secure software development. I love hacking stuff
together, but I'm not the right person for a large dev project
- You want something hacked that you don't explicitly own and have permission to
test.

### Do contact me if

- You want to identify impactful flaws and vulnerabilities in your code or applications
- You want a meaningful assessment of your application's strengths and weaknesses
- You want to educate your software developers on how to write more secure code
- You want to train your engineers on security tooling and methodologies
