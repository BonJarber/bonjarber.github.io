# I'm here to help

I love helping organizations improve their security in a meaningful way. Working
with me will give you a more personal connection than you get with most large
consulting companies.

I can perform a security review of an application, review source code, host
talks or workshops, or make your appsec/prodsec/bug bounty program run better.

### You probably * don't * want to contact me if

- You're looking for an audit or other checklist assessment. I look to provide
more than just a report.
- You need forensic, incident response, or physical security services. Not my
expertise.
- You want an engagement lasting longer than 2-3 weeks at a time. I prefer
short, high impact and time boxed work.
- You need a large amount of secure software development. I love hacking stuff
together, but I'm not the right person for a large dev project

### You probably * do * want to contact me if

- You want a meaningful assessment of your software's security posture
- You want to know what digital assets you have exposed to the Internet
- You want analysis and feedback on the design and execution of your
AppSec/ProdSec team
- You want to educate your software developers on how to write more secure code
- You want to train your security engineers to be more effective
- You have an interesting project in mind

Got something in mind? Let's talk.
