#### TLDR
I've started a company to help make the Internet more secure. I'm doing this in
two ways:

1. Sharing my security expertise via consulting.
2. Building tools to more effectively find vulnerable assets on the Internet and
 report them via bug bounty.

## Knowledge

I've been doing AppSec professionally for over 5 years. My years as an NCC Group
 consultant exposed me to hundreds of different apps, gave me a ton of reps
breaking applications, and taught me how to be a useful consultant.

There's an element of personalized, high quality consulting that tooling simply
can't replace yet. Security is still too human of a space. I think one of the
more valuable ways I can spend my time is transferring whatever knowledge I have
to others so they can make use of it.

This knowledge transfer can take the shape of a pentest, a design review, a code
 review, or a workshop/lecture for your software or security engineers. If this
interests you, head over to the [services](/services/index.html) page.

## Scale

The problem with consulting is that it doesn't scale well. Growing simply via
bodies means you can't guarantee the quality of services to maintain. Tooling on
the other hand, when built well, can scale massively.

I'm dedicating time to building tooling to more effectively find security bugs
that exist on the Internet. Bug bounty programs with safe harbor policies
provide a nice legal framework for this, so for the time being I'm only focusing
on companies that have such policies.

## Interested?

I'm currently taking on new gigs to start in the new year. If you're interested
in working with me please reach out soon, I'd love to hear what you have in
mind. Shoot me a message via the [services](/services/index.html) page or DM me
