#### TLDR
I've started a company to help make the Internet more secure. I'm doing this in
two ways:

1. Sharing my security expertise via consulting.
2. Building tools to find vulnerable assets on the Internet and report them via
bug bounty programs.

## Knowledge

I've been doing AppSec professionally for almost 6 years. My years as an NCC
Group consultant exposed me to hundreds of different apps. This gave me a ton of
 reps breaking applications, and taught me how to be a useful consultant.

There's an element of personalized, high quality consulting that tooling can't
replace yet. Security is still too human of a space. One of the more valuable
ways I can spend my time is transferring whatever knowledge I have to others.

This knowledge transfer can come in a couple different forms:
- Application penetration test
- Design review
- Code review
- Training session for your software or security engineers.

If this interests you, head over to the [services(/services/index.html) page.

## Scale

The problem with consulting is that it doesn't scale well. Growing simply via
bodies means you can't guarantee the quality of services to maintain. Tooling on
the other hand, when built well, can scale massively.

I'm dedicating time to building tooling to more effectively find security bugs
that exist on the Internet. <a href="https://disclose.io/">Safe harbor policies
</a> provide a nice legal framework for this kind of work, so I'm focusing only
on companies with such policies.

## Interested?

I'm currently taking on new gigs to start in the new year. If you're interested
in working with me please reach out soon, I'd love to hear what you have in
mind. Shoot me a message via the [services](/services/index.html) page or DM me
