										<p>
											I help organizations improve the security of their web
											applications through more than a bland report. I've done
											both professional penetration testing and an internal
											security engineering and now share this experience with
											organizations.
										</p>
										<p>
											Working with me will give you a more personal connection
											than you get with most large consulting companies.	I can
											perform security reviews of your applications, review source
											code, host talks or workshops, or make your
											appsec/prodsec/bug bounty program run better.

										I'll review your web application for common security
										vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQLi, CSRF, logic and auth
										flaws, sensitive data exposure, etc. These engagements can
										range from fully remote blackbox tests to deep dives into the code base
										 onsite with your engineers. I'm flexible to the needs of your
										 organization.

										<b>For Developers</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										I teach developers how malicious individuals are going to
										attack their code, what they can do to write more secure
										code, and how to think like an attacker when designing new
										systems.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>For Security Engineers</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										I do onsite web application security testing methodology and
										tooling training for junior security engineers and
										developers interested in security. This can also include
										how to do secure code review, threat modeling, and security
										automation.
